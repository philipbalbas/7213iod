# URL Editor Challenge

The challenge is to build an app to help a user construct and edit complicated urls.

This tool should have the following functionality:

* A user should be able to paste in a url into a text area.
* The app should break the url into its parts (protocol, hostname, etc..), and for each part:
  * The user should be able to edit that particular part (e.g. change the hostname) and the app should update the text representation
  * Particular attention should be given to the query parameters (e.g. `?some=param&another=item`):
    * The user should be able to edit any number of arbitrary query parameters
    * The user should be able to add additional query parameters
    * The user should be able to remove query parameters

## Rules

* Follow these [coding style guidelines](https://gist.github.com/davidguttman/9fbdd0e9ee1fb3b33f5cf693195f2edb#code-style).
* Do not add any additional modules/dependencies. Use `choo` for the app and components, and `sheetify` + `tachyons` for styling.
* Your solution will be judged on usability, maintainability, and style.
* Do not fork this repo. Create a new repo with a slug generated by https://cuid.js.la
* Your solution should be made deployed and available using https://surge.sh
